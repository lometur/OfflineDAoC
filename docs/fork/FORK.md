# About this fork

HearthDAoC (`lometur/HearthDAoC`) is an unofficial fork of [shadowofze/OfflineDAoC](https://github.com/shadowofze/OfflineDAoC).
It runs OfflineDAoC as a central multiplayer server and keeps its own changes small and additive,
so upstream updates merge cleanly.

The fork was renamed from its working title ("OfflineDAoC central server fork") to HearthDAoC on
2026-10-05, before its first release. The sub-project 1 spec, plan and verification record keep the
old names (`odc`, `OFFLINEDAOC_*`, `offlinedaoc-*`) as written at the time.

## What the fork changes

| Change | Paths | Upstream files touched |
|---|---|---|
| Fork banner | `README.md` (top lines), `.github/README.md` | `README.md` |
| Container deployment | `deploy/`, `.dockerignore`, `.github/workflows/server-image.yml` | none |
| Linux admin CLIs | `tools/linux/` (link upstream sources; see each project file) | none |
| Bot goals with upstream's Battlegrounds column (`hdc bot-goals`) | `tools/linux/bot-goals/Program.cs`, `deploy/hdc` | none: `set` takes Battlegrounds as an optional fourth number and keeps it when left out; the owner's split is in `deploy/HANDOFF.md` (Bot goals), set by hand, not by default |
| Server data files from the release (`classic-quests.json`, `classic-quest-guides.json`) | `deploy/upstream.lock` (`server_prefix`, `server_files`), `deploy/bin/init_world.py`, `deploy/entrypoint.sh` | none: not in the image. The first start of an upstream version downloads them, checked against the release manifest, into `/data/server-files/<upstream version>/`, and every start links them into `/app/server`. `classic-otd.json` is left out: nothing reads it |
| World upgrade in `hdc update` | `deploy/hdc`, `deploy/bin/world_admin.py` | none: a release for another upstream version runs `./hdc upgrade-world` (the new release's own) before it starts the server |
| What a world upgrade keeps besides upstream's progress tables, and `hdc carry-rvr` | `deploy/bin/world_admin.py`, `deploy/bin/carry_rvr.py`, `deploy/hdc` | none: upstream's import engine copies only the progress tables of `progress-policy.json` and clears `Ban`, `SinglePermission` and `KeepCaptureLog`. `upgrade-world` then copies bans and single permissions, and the RvR state that came from play, so upstream's own changes to untouched keeps and relics stay: for keeps in play in the old world (Realm is not OriginalRealm, or claimed; matched by Name and Region, not KeepID), `Keep` Realm, Level and ClaimedGuildName, Health and State of their `Door` rows (both from the old row; Health at most the door's full health in the new world at the carried Level, by the server's formula), and their `KeepHookPointItem` rows (with the new KeepID); for relics away from home, `Relic` position and holder; and `KeepCaptureLog`. A table or needed column missing in either world leaves that part out, with a note in the report. `hdc carry-rvr <archive>` copies the same state from an archived world into the live one, after a backup, leaving out a claim whose guild holds another keep there. `battlegrounds.py` step 3 lowers a central keep's gates to Level 1's full health when it puts the keep back to Level 1 |
| Player setup, and Linux client updates at launch (see Client updates) | `client/`, `deploy/build_bundles.sh` (the bundle's `VERSION`) | none |
| Classic character creation and splash (client patch set) | `client/patches/`, `client/windows/patch-client.*` | none: patches each player's own client files (see Client patches) |
| Leveling spawns (owner's choice) | `deploy/bin/spawns.py`, `hdc spawns`; the twin removal run by `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py` (every start); tests `deploy/tests/test_spawns.py` | none: restores rows upstream's setup archived in `offline_classic165_removed_mobs`. Its "creature still in the world" check compares names without case, so it brought back twins of named quest monsters: an "arawnite messenger" 170 units from level 20's "Arawnite Messenger", and quests then matched a kill's name exactly, so killing it counted for nothing (owner test 2026-10-10; quests now match names without case, see "Quest targets and givers match a spawn's name without case", but the twins stay left out as duplicates). The restore leaves out an archived row within 1000 units (X, Y) of a live monster whose name differs from its own only in case and is a quest's kill target (a stage of StepType 0 or 1, the name part of TargetName, without case); on the clean 0.35 world that is the messenger at levels 1-20 (12,873 restored), with six "cornwall hunter" near the Cornwall hunters at 1-25 (14,840), 14 at 1-50. A world an earlier restore gave twins loses them at its next start: only rows listed in `fork_restored_mobs`, removed from `Mob` and untracked as `hdc spawns undo` does, so they stay in the archive ("Restored spawns: N twins of quest targets removed ...") |
| Duplicate townspeople in the world data (every start) | `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py` (`remove_duplicate_townspeople`), tests `deploy/tests/test_world_fixes.py` | none: removes the plain `GameNPC` copy of Ley Manton and Tria Ellowis standing exactly on their `GameMerchant`, archived in `fork_removed_mobs` (FixId `duplicate-townspeople`); Albion's two town merchants showed twice in game (owner test 2026-10-09) |
| Classic battlegrounds 15-35, world data (once per world, marker `classic-battlegrounds-v2`) | `deploy/bin/battlegrounds.py` (run by `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py`) | none: on the 0.35 world it levels all four central keeps (upstream's Dun Abermenai and Dun Murdaigean included) and their gates, adds the portal keep guards, and six wall casters and a hastener in each of upstream's two keeps, and removes the Atlas leftovers ([spec](specs/2026-10-07-classic-battlegrounds-design.md), section 7) |
| Period corrections to monsters in the world data (every start) | `deploy/bin/mob_fixes.py`, `deploy/bin/mob_fixes.json` (run by `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py`, last), tests `deploy/tests/test_mob_fixes.py` | none: each entry names a `Mob` row (by `Mob_ID`) or the `NpcTemplate` rows of a `TemplateId`, the values upstream ships (`expect`), the values to set and why, with its source. No marker: a row changes only while it holds every `expect` value, so the owner's changes stay; kept rows are named in the start log at every start. A column the table lacks stops the fix ("Mob fixes: not applied"). First entries (owner 2026-10-10): level 11's thieves Frund and Agisthil at their period level 10 (Allakhazam bestiary 2002-09-21), and Frund moved from far west to the red dwarf camp beside Agisthil (the 2001-2002 walkthrough and comments) |
| Design docs | `docs/fork/` | none |

Server code under `source/server` was unchanged in sub-project 1. Every later server-code change is
listed here, so upstream syncs can account for it:

| Change | Files | Why | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/rp off` at any level | `GameServer/commands/playercommands/rp.cs` (the level check removed, marked `// HearthDAoC:`), source check `deploy/tests/test_player_commands.py` | A player under a battleground's realm point cap can stop gaining realm points and stay in (owner 2026-10-09); OpenDAoC allowed it only from level 40. A quest that gives realm points can't be finished while it is off (upstream's rule) | Fork-only |
| `/harm` kills count for quests | `GameServer/commands/gmcommands/harm.cs` (one block, marked `// HearthDAoC:`), source checks `deploy/tests/test_player_commands.py` (a unit test would need a live player, client and region) | A death tells only the attackers in the target's `AttackerTracker` (`GameLiving.ProcessDeath`), which real attacks and spells fill through `AddAttacker`; `/harm` called `TakeDamage` alone, so a `/harm` kill never reached a quest (owner test 2026-10-10: Frund killed with `/harm` advanced nothing; a swing first, then `/harm`, worked). The GM now joins the target's attackers first, as a real attack does (an `AttackData` with the GM as attacker; not a melee attack) | Candidate, after the in-game run (ask the owner first) |
| `command_plvl_overrides` server property (e.g. `/tele=2;/tc=2`) | `GameServer/gameutils/ScriptMgr.cs` (`CommandPrivLevel`, applied in `LoadCommands`), `GameServer/serverproperty/ServerProperties.cs`, test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_CommandPrivLevelOverrides.cs` | Makes single-player teleports GM-only on a shared server (#38); set from `HEARTHDAOC_GM_ONLY_COMMANDS` | Candidate: generic, off by default |
| Shrouded Isles start choice: `si_start_choice` server property | `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/SiStartChoice.cs` (the decisions), `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/SiStartChoiceScript.cs` (the property and the game wiring), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_SiStartChoice.cs`. Upstream files touched: none | A new character of a classic race is asked once, a few seconds after its first entry into the world, whether to begin in its realm's Shrouded Isles town (#40, [spec](specs/2026-10-06-shrouded-isles-start-choice-design.md)); set from `HEARTHDAOC_SI_START_CHOICE` (default on) | Candidate: off by default |
| Classic battlegrounds: porter levels and caps, realm rank caps on every way in (players and bots), over-limit moves, keep level after a capture | `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/ClassicBattlegrounds.cs` (the decisions), `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/ClassicBattlegroundsScript.cs` (the hooks and the game wiring), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_ClassicBattlegrounds.cs`, source checks `deploy/tests/test_battlegrounds.py`. Upstream files touched, each hook marked `// HearthDAoC:` (in `OFTeleporters.cs`, by the `HearthDAoC.` namespace in the call, since the source check wants each block to be the call and `break;` only): `GameServer/scripts/teleporters/OFTeleporters.cs` (three blocks: the frontier porter), `GameServer/scripts/teleporters/BattlegroundTeleportOptions.cs` (one block: the town teleporters' [Battlegrounds] choice), `GameServer/keeps/KeepManager.cs` (the cap in `GetBGPK`), `GameServer/bots/autonomous/AutonomousBotGoalPolicy.cs` (one: `ReconcileSavedAssignment`, the new goal for a saved record), `GameServer/bots/autonomous/AutonomousObjectiveAssignments.cs` (two: `CanTakeBattleground`, `Assign`), `GameServer/bots/autonomous/AutonomousWorldBotController.Battleground.cs` (one: `ExecuteBattleground`), `GameServer/bots/autonomous/AutonomousWorldBotController.cs` (two: the camp offer in `SelectCamp`, `TravelAcrossRegions`; both check every member of a shared party), and the twelve battleground quest files in `GameServer/scripts/quests/BattlegroundQuests/` (Thidranki and Caledonia), deleted (nothing left to mark; the source check finds no class of theirs) | The four classic battlegrounds for levels 15-35 with their realm rank caps, the porter's reasons, over-limit characters at their bind point, no Atlas daily quests (#76, [spec](specs/2026-10-07-classic-battlegrounds-design.md)). Since upstream 0.35 (#50), the caps hold on every way in: the frontier porter, the town teleporters' [Battlegrounds] choice (the porter's refusal text; game masters are exempt, as from upstream's level check) and `GetBGPK`. A gamebot at or over a battleground's cap gets no battleground goal for it and is never sent in; one already inside stays until it leaves or dies. Upstream's `BattlegroundBrackets` still says level is the only limit: the fork adds the caps | Fork-only. The "Svasud Faste" fix that was a candidate is upstream's own since 0.35 |
| Quest dependencies by quest ID (`#id`, `#a/b`, `!#a/b`) | `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/QuestDependencies.cs` (new), `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/DataQuest.cs` (`ParseQuestData`, `CheckQuestQualification`, marked), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_DataQuestDependency.cs` | Upstream's epic chains reuse names, so a name can't say which step comes before (#73, [spec](specs/2026-10-09-epic-chains-design.md)) | Candidate, after the in-game run (ask the owner first) |
| A delivery step doesn't hand a second copy of an item the player carries, a quest starting with a delivery hands its item, and a turn-in can need several items (`id;N`) | `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/QuestDeliveryItems.cs` (new), `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/DataQuest.cs` (`AdvanceQuestStep`, the Deliver/DeliverFinish block, `StartOffered`, and `OnPlayerGiveItem` with the new `OtherCollectItems` and `RemoveCollectItems`, marked; and the class header), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_DataQuestDeliveryItem.cs` | Upstream hands a Deliver or DeliverFinish step's item when the step begins even if an earlier step, or the step just finishing, already gave it: "Traveler's Way -- Supply Run" gave two bundles at Thol Dunnin, and 77 classic quests have the pattern (owner test 2026-10-09). The item is handed only if the backpack has none and the finishing step isn't handing it; the copy being handed over to finish the step doesn't count, so a step that hands the same item back still does (62 classic quests, among them the level 20 and 43 Guild of Shadows quests); ids compare without case. Accepting a quest whose first step is a delivery never handed that step's item (nothing "begins" step 1), so 56 classic quests, among them the level 30 Regal Nobility, could not be finished: the item is now handed on accept (with no free backpack slot the quest does not start). A first delivery back to the giver hands nothing: the giver wants the player to bring it (11 classic quests, such as 20098 "Sveabone Hilt Sword": "buy me a bronze short sword"). A CollectItemTemplate entry `id;N` (N a number of 2 or more) needs N of the item: an NPC is only ever handed one item (`PlayerMoveItemRequestHandler`), so the level 11 "Entry Into Tomorrow", rebuilt to the period story (owner 2026-10-09: Omis takes both thieves' stones and makes the Crediac), could not ask for two non-stacking stones. Handing one over with fewer than N in the backpack advances and takes nothing (the NPC says the step's TargetText on a Collect or Deliver step, and the player is told "Omis needs 2 of them."); with N or more the step advances as before and takes the item handed over and N-1 more (a stack only the copies wanted). The match is upstream's (the item id contains the entry's id, without case); any other entry (`id`, `id;1`, `id;x`) is read as upstream reads it | Candidate, after the in-game run (ask the owner first) |
| A data quest asks "Do you accept?" before it starts | `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/DataQuestOffers.cs` (new), `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/DataQuest.cs` (`CheckOfferedQuestWhisper`, the new `StartOffered`, marked; and the class header), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_DataQuestOffers.cs` | Upstream started a Standard quest the moment the player whispered its key word to the giver (about 1,300 classic quests). The owner wants the player asked first (2026-10-09): the whisper now sends the client's quest prompt (`<NPC> offers you the quest "<name>". Do you accept?`) with the reserved ID `0xFFF0` and remembers one pending offer per player (a newer one replaces it; dropped on quit, pruned after 5 minutes). Accept starts the quest if the answer comes from the same NPC, the offer is under 5 minutes old and the player still qualifies and is alive; decline drops the offer and the NPC says "Come back when you're ready.". A giver that is not a GameNPC starts the quest at once. A full journal (more than 25 quests and the player already doing a data quest, as `GamePlayer.AddQuest` refuses) gets no prompt and, if it fills while the prompt is open, no record, item or text: it says `Your quest journal is full. Finish or abandon a quest first.` (`DataQuestOffers.JournalIsFull`; before, the refused quest stayed saved at step 1 and showed in the journal at the next login without its item) | Candidate, after the in-game run (ask the owner first) |
| Quest targets and givers match a spawn's name without case | `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/QuestNames.cs` (new), `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/DataQuest.cs` (the quest indicators in `AdvanceQuestStep`, `OnPlayerInteract`, `OnPlayerGiveItem`, `OnPlayerWhisper`, `OnEnemyKilled`, marked; and the class header), `GameServer/gameobjects/GameNPC.cs` (`CanFinishOneQuest`, the quest indicator, marked), `GameServer/gameobjects/GameObject.cs` (`LoadDataQuests`, the giver check, marked), `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/QuestDeliveryItems.cs` (`IsGiver` uses it), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_QuestNames.cs`, world scan and source checks `deploy/tests/test_quest_names.py` | DataQuest compared a step's TargetName and a quest's StartName with an object's name exactly, but upstream's quest data spells many of them differently from the names they spawn with (the Mob row's, or its NpcTemplate's when that replaces the mob's values). Level 20 "Path of the Renegade" wants "Arawnite Messenger", whose NpcTemplate 12071 ("arawnite messenger", ReplaceMobValues 1) names him at every spawn, so his kill never counted (owner test 2026-10-10). The names now compare ordinal, without case (`QuestNames.Same`); spacing still counts and the region checks are unchanged. On the clean 0.35 world (after the world fixes) that unblocks 104 quest rows: 103 with a step whose target exists in its region only under other capitals (25 names, such as kill "Cornwall hunter", "Fanged Sinach", "Druid" at Lough Gur, "Isolationist Courier" for the Guild of Shadows 45 and "witch", interact "Elder Tidal Sheerie" and "Dverge Smith"), and 21352 "Impossible Mission", whose giver "Albion Runner" spawns as "Albion runner". No quest's match widens to another creature: no region holds a quest's name both exactly and under other capitals. The twins `hdc spawns` restored beside such targets (Leveling spawns, above) would count now too; they are still left out as duplicates. ClassicQuests' custom steps already compared without case. Left as they are: 22 step targets not in the world data, which upstream's classic-quests.json spawns at their step, and the givers of the collection quests 117 and 217 ("Aserod Ilonus", "Asdis"), which nothing spawns | Candidate, after the in-game run (ask the owner first) |
| HearthDAoC's quest data file | `GameServer/quests/QuestsMgr/ClassicQuests.cs` (`Reload`, `Merge`, `ReadExtra`, `MarkerFor`, `QuestInfo.Replace`, marked), `deploy/hearthdaoc-quests.json` (copied next to the server by `deploy/Dockerfile`), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_ClassicQuestsExtra.cs`, shape tests `deploy/tests/test_epic_chains.py` (`ExtraQuestFileTests`) | Map markers for the level-50 Lord of Deceit and Lord Elidyn on the gamebots' leave-alone list; upstream's entry wins on the same quest ID, unless ours says `"Replace": true`: a quest the fork rebuilt needs its own entry. Level 11 "Entry Into Tomorrow" (20157, 20155, 20156, 20159, 20158) replaces upstream's: its six stages, with stage 2's marker on Frund at the red dwarf camp (`deploy/bin/mob_fixes.json` moves him), no Crediac reissue at stage 4 (upstream's, by "Agisthil", was written for its old design), and Omis handing another Crediac at stage 6 to a player who lost it (owner 2026-10-10). Its optional `Chat` section replaces upstream's NPC replies keyword by keyword (NPC names and keywords compare without case, an empty reply silences a line): the Guild of Shadows chain's upstream replies called every class "Cabalist" or held walkthrough notes | Fork-only (upstream edits its own file) |
| The epic chains in the world data | `deploy/bin/epic_chains.py`, `deploy/bin/epic_chains_data.json`, run by `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py` once per world (marker `epic-chains-v1`), tests `deploy/tests/test_epic_chains.py` | The Guild of Shadows chain 7→50 in order with every reward and the real level-50 "Lord of Deceit" (quests 990509, 990511, 990513, 990512, 990519; Lord Elidyn's camp from upstream's archive); every guild line's steps in order (87 rows); the 41 missing rewards and weapons, every Guild of Shadows reward locked to its class, upstream's broken rewards fixed; the old `Shadows_50` progress carried over | The data changes are a candidate (as SQL), after the in-game run |
| The Guild of Shadows chain's dialogue in the world data (every start) | `deploy/bin/quest_dialogue.py`, `deploy/bin/quest_dialogue.json`, run by `deploy/bin/world_fixes.py` right after the epic chains, tests `deploy/tests/test_quest_dialogue.py`; the chat lines are in `deploy/hearthdaoc-quests.json` | none: upstream left most of the chain's dialogue (levels 7 to 50) empty ("[Traveler's]") or filled with walkthrough notes; the owner asked for dialogue "as though it's a real quest being given" for the whole chain, every class's version (owner test 2026-10-09). No marker: it rewrites a quest's `AcceptText`, `Description`, `SourceText`, `StepText`, `TargetText`, `AdvanceText`, `FinishText` and `StepItemTemplates` (and `StepType` and `CollectItemTemplate`: a stage's type and turn-in may change, never the number of stages; and the giver and dependencies, `StartName` and `QuestDependency`: the Shrouded Isles 7 and 11 are given by each class's own trainer in Caer Gothwaite, not the Necromancer trainer Carys, and each 11 needs the 7 of its own branch, as in the period; both still lead to 15) at every start, only where they still hold upstream's text or an earlier version of the file's own (guard digests), so the owner's edits stay and a later revision reaches older worlds. To revise the text: edit it, run `python3 deploy/bin/quest_dialogue.py --seal` (appends the digest of the file's own text to each quest's guard list, no world needed) and commit; a test (`SealedTests`) fails until you do, so every committed version is guarded. `--digests WORLD.db [--current]` (the digests of the text a world holds) is still needed when an entry's set of columns changes | The data changes are a candidate (as SQL), after the in-game run |
| Level-50 epic quest code | `GameServer/scripts/quests/Albion/epic/Shadows50.cs` deleted (the Defenders copy); one lookup line each in `GameServer/scripts/quests/Albion/epic/Academy50.cs`, `Hibernia/epic/Essence50.cs`, `Midgard/epic/Mystic50.cs`, `Midgard/epic/Viking50.cs` (marked); source checks in `deploy/tests/test_epic_chains.py` | The Guild of Shadows 50 was the Defenders quest; the four others made a second NPC at every start when a GM had saved one | Candidate, after the in-game run |
| `/epic` (GM only) | `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/EpicChain.cs` (the decisions), `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/EpicCommand.cs` (the command), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_EpicChain.cs` | Testing an epic chain quickly: list, `done <level>`, `goto`, `reset`. `goto` leads to the active stage's marker, or to the next step's giver: of the steps whose dependencies are met, the one given in the character's region (the Shrouded Isles 7 for a character in the Isles), else the first. A step that needs only quests closed to the character is closed too (after the Shrouded Isles 7, Camelot's 11), and the list says why | Fork-only |
| `/indicator` (GM only, a test tool) | `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/QuestIndicatorProbe.cs` (the decisions and the store), `GameServer/scripts/hearthdaoc/IndicatorCommand.cs` (the command and the store's game wiring), `GameServer/gameobjects/GameNPC.cs` (`GetQuestIndicator` asks the GM's value first: one block, marked), test `Tests/UnitTests/UT_QuestIndicatorProbe.cs`, source checks `deploy/tests/test_player_commands.py` | The owner's client (1.127) shows two indicator styles, a ring at an NPC's feet and a knot over its head, and the server reaches it two ways: the flags of the NPC create packet (`PacketLib1124.SendNPCCreate`) and the quest effect packet (`PacketLib173.SendNPCsQuestEffect`). To choose a scheme, the owner needs to see each way and value once (2026-10-10). On the GM's target, for the GM's client only: `effect <0-255>` sends the quest effect with a raw byte; `create <none|available|finish|lesson|lore|pending>` makes the create packet carry that indicator and re-creates the NPC; `refresh` re-sends the real indicator both ways, the create packet first; `clear` drops the GM's values; the bare command says what the real indicator is and why (each data and scripted quest, the steps at the NPC, and a class that overrides `GetQuestIndicator`). A value lasts until `clear` or `refresh`, the GM's logout, or the NPC leaving the world (death included). A class that overrides `GetQuestIndicator` without asking GameNPC's first never sees the value; the command says so. The owner's first run (2026-10-10): the quest effect drew nothing (`/mob refreshquests` on Elaru, a level-7 Infiltrator beside her), a new login drew her indicator. So the re-create copies a login's view of the NPC: the remove packet, then, 1 second later (the client has dropped the NPC by then, and the GM sees it go and come back), `ClientService.CreateObjectForPlayer`, the create an NPC gets when it comes into view or when the client asks for an object it lacks: the create packet, the equipment, the GM's target again | No: a test tool |

## Client patches

The patch set `client/patches/classic-creation.json` gives the OfflineDAoC 0.35 classic client a classic
character creation screen and the HearthDAoC loading splash (sub-project 2, see
[its spec](specs/2026-10-06-classic-character-creation-design.md)). It holds only SHA-256 hashes, byte and text edits
and our own code, never an EA file. The launchers apply it at every launch, just before the game starts, so
files that something put back (a repair, OfflineDAoC's own launcher) are patched again:

- Linux: `setup.sh` installs the bundle's `patches/` (`apply_patches.py`, `patchset.py`, `classic-creation.json`,
  `splash.mpk`) as `<dest>/patches`, a fresh copy on every run, and applies it from there. `play.sh` runs
  `<dest>/patches/apply_patches.py` before every launch.
- Windows: `connect-hearthdaoc.bat` runs `patch-client.ps1` (`client/windows/`, same rules as the Linux
  applier) from its own folder before every start of `connect.exe`. `patch-client.bat` runs it by hand, for
  example `-Restore`, or once as administrator when the install is under Program Files.

An already patched client is only read. Exit 3 (a client file the patch set doesn't know) starts the game with
the standard creation screen; any other failure warns and still starts it. Without the installed patches
(`<dest>/patches`, or `patch-client.ps1` next to the .bat) the launchers don't patch: that is how a player opts
out, after a restore. Both appliers refuse any other client file, such as the b edition's `game.dll` or an older
or newer upstream client's, and then change nothing. Both keep each original as `<file>.hearthdaoc-orig` and put it back with `--restore` /
`-Restore`, but only over the patched file: when a file has changed since it was patched (for example a newer
upstream client), the restore says so and changes nothing.

| What is patched | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-assign stops after its reset: race base stats and 30 points to place (P1) | `game.dll`, VA `0x59C0B2` | Classic stat points (#39) |
| Continue checks unspent points for new characters too (P2) | `game.dll`, VA `0x59A853` (28 bytes) | Creation can't finish until all 30 are placed (#39) |
| The attributes window starts open (P3) | `game.dll`, VA `0x59C574` | The points are placed right away (#39) |
| A hook calls our code cave after class registration | `game.dll`, VA `0x5B0051`; a new last section `.hdcc` (with the section count, `SizeOfCode`, `SizeOfImage` and checksum), after upstream's `.bounty` in 0.35, at VA `0x248C000` | The cave hides the full classes and the races after Shrouded Isles, and registers the 15 base classes with their descriptions (#55) |
| The Optimize button is removed | `pregame/character_customize_stats.xml` (ControlId 1021) | No auto-assign (#39) |
| The loading splash is replaced by our `splash.mpk` | `pregame/splash.mpk` | HEARTH DAoC lettering (#54) |

Sources, in `client/patches/`: `build.py` (the generator: stat-flow bytes, XML edit, cave section and hook),
`src/baseclass.asm` (the cave, nasm), `classdata.py` (base classes and races from the server's class files and
the world's `disabled_classes`), `src/base_classes.py` (descriptions and highlighted stats), `branding/` (the
splash) and the Linux applier (`apply_patches.py`, `patchset.py`).

The splash is OfflineDAoC's artwork (upstream keeps it as
`source/tools/OfflineDaoc.Launcher/Assets/offline-daoc-client-splash.mpk`), re-lettered "HEARTH DAoC" in Cinzel
(SIL Open Font License) by `branding/reletter_splash.py`. Credit for the art goes to OfflineDAoC.
`client/patches/splash.mpk` is committed, and the patch set pins its SHA-256 as the splash entry's `after`. It is
not built at release time: an MPK packed again by upstream's MPK tool carries new timestamps, so a new hash, and
a client patched by one release would then be unknown to the next release's appliers. `deploy/build_bundles.sh`
copies the committed file into the client bundle and builds nothing when its hash isn't the pinned one, so
releases need no .NET.

**Changing the splash.** Re-letter `branding/splash.png` (`branding/reletter_splash.py`), build `splash.mpk`
from it with `branding/build_splash_mpk.py` (needs upstream's MPK tool, `source/tools/OfflineDaoc.Mpk`, and the
.NET 10 SDK), rebuild `classic-creation.json` (below), and commit `splash.png`, `splash.mpk` and the JSON
together. CI checks that they agree: `client/patches/tests/test_splash.py` fails when `splash.mpk` doesn't
hold `splash.png`, and the rebuild check fails when the JSON doesn't pin `splash.mpk`.

```bash
dotnet build source/tools/OfflineDaoc.Mpk/OfflineDaoc.Mpk.csproj -c Release
python3 client/patches/branding/build_splash_mpk.py --mpk-tool source/tools/OfflineDaoc.Mpk/bin/Release/net10.0/OfflineDaoc.Mpk.dll
```

The base-class list is generated for the shipped classic world's `disabled_classes`, with Disciple enabled as
`deploy/bin/world_fixes.py` does. On a server that disables more classes, a base class whose full classes are
all disabled is still offered, and the server refuses it at creation. Rebuilding the patch set with that
world's database (`--world-db`) fixes it.

**Rebuilding the patch set.** `classic-creation.json` is generated, never edited by hand. Rebuild it after a
change to anything above, to the server's class files or to `deploy/upstream.lock`. CI rebuilds it on every run
from the pinned release's files and fails ("Client patch set matches a rebuild") when the committed file
differs. A change to the generator alone (`build.py`, `pe.py`, `classdata.py`, `src/`,
`branding/reletter_splash.py`) or to upstream's MPK tool makes no release; the rebuilt `classic-creation.json`,
`branding/splash.png` or `splash.mpk` does. You need nasm (`sudo apt install nasm`); the rebuild uses the
committed `splash.mpk`. From the repository root:

```bash
c="$(mktemp -d)"  # EA files from the pinned release, verified; never commit or share them
python3 tools/linux/odaoc_fetch.py --lock deploy/upstream.lock extract editions/0.35-no-custom-class/runtime/client-opendaoc/app/game.dll "$c/game.dll"
python3 tools/linux/odaoc_fetch.py --lock deploy/upstream.lock extract runtime/client-opendaoc/app/pregame/character_customize_stats.xml "$c/pregame/character_customize_stats.xml"
python3 tools/linux/odaoc_fetch.py --lock deploy/upstream.lock extract runtime/client-opendaoc/app/pregame/splash.mpk "$c/pregame/splash.mpk"
python3 tools/linux/odaoc_fetch.py --lock deploy/upstream.lock extract editions/0.35-no-custom-class/runtime/data/opendaoc.sqlite3.db "$c/world.db"
python3 client/patches/build.py --client "$c" --world-db "$c/world.db" --server-src source/server \
  --splash-mpk client/patches/splash.mpk --out client/patches/classic-creation.json
HDC_CLIENT_FILES="$c" HDC_TEST_WORLD="$c/world.db" python3 -m unittest discover -s client/patches/tests -t client/patches
rm -rf "$c"
```

The archive paths are the lock's `editions.classic` and `client_prefix` (the world database is about 90 MB).
The tests skip the real-file cases without `HDC_CLIENT_FILES` and `HDC_TEST_WORLD`, the MPK cases without
`HDC_MPK_TOOL` (the `OfflineDaoc.Mpk.dll` built for the splash above) and the PowerShell cases without `pwsh`
(or `HDC_PWSH`). CI sets all of them; `ClientPatchWorkflowTests` in `deploy/tests/test_workflows.py` (needs
ruby) keep the workflow that way. `setup.sh` run from a checkout installs `client/patches/` (with the committed
`splash.mpk`) as `<dest>/patches` and applies it from there.

If the pinned release's classic `game.dll` changes, `build.py` refuses it until the patch sites in `build.py`,
`classdata.py` and `src/baseclass.asm` are found again in the new file. Until then CI fails and players with
the new client keep the standard creation screen. A new upstream section moves `.hdcc` to a new address (0.35
added `.bounty`): `ORG` in `client/patches/tests/test_cave.py`, the section list in `test_pe.py` and the header
offsets in `test_build.py` pin it, so update them with it. Players must then update their client: a `game.dll`
of the old release, patched or not, is unknown to the new patch set (see the
[v0.35b-hearth.1 release notes](https://github.com/lometur/HearthDAoC/releases/tag/v0.35b-hearth.1)).

**Changing the `game.dll` patch later.** Players' clients stay patched by the release they had, and the
launchers apply the new release's patch set at the next launch. A `game.dll` patched by an older patch set is
neither "before" nor "after" for the new one, so both appliers would refuse it (exit 3, nothing changed: the
player keeps the old patch and is told the client isn't supported), and a restore would refuse it as changed
since it was patched. The same holds for any patched file whose "after" changes. Such a change must also teach
both appliers to upgrade: recognise the older patched file, put its verified backup back, then apply the new
set.

## Client updates

Linux clients update at launch, after asking the player. Windows players still copy the new files by hand.

- `deploy/build_bundles.sh` writes the release tag into the client bundle's `VERSION`, and the client's content
  ID into `CONTENT_ID` and beside the bundle as the release asset `hearthdaoc-client-<tag>.content-id`: the
  SHA-256 of the bundled files' `sha256sum` lines in path order, without `VERSION`. Two releases of the same
  client have the same ID.
- `setup.sh` saves its options (`--server`, `--edition`, `--base-client`, made absolute), that tag and that
  content ID (`content_id`, empty from a checkout or an older bundle) in
  `<dest>/hearthdaoc-client.conf`, last and by a rename, so a failed setup keeps the previous release. From a
  checkout there is no `VERSION`, the tag is empty and `play.sh` never checks. It also writes `play.sh` as
  `play.sh.new` and renames it: a running `play.sh` that updates itself goes on reading its own file.
- Over an installed client, `setup.sh` builds the new one in `<dest>/client.new` (hard links to the old
  client, or a full copy where hard links fail) and keeps the old patches in `<dest>/patches.old`. It swaps
  them in only when everything worked; a failed setup, say a download that stops, leaves the install as it
  was. rsync, `odaoc_fetch.py` and the patches replace files by a rename and never write into them, so the
  hard-linked old client stays as it was. A first setup builds `<dest>/client` in place.
- At each launch, before the login, `play.sh` reads that file (never sources it) and asks GitHub's releases
  page (`.../releases/latest`, as `hdc update` does) for the newest tag, for 5 seconds at most. For tests,
  `HEARTHDAOC_RELEASES_URL` points `play.sh` (and `hdc`) at a local server instead; players never set it. It
  offers a newer tag (`sort -V`, with 0.35 before 0.35b) with a zenity or terminal question, unless that
  release's `.content-id` (fetched for 5 seconds at most) equals the saved `content_id`: a release that changes
  only the server plays on with one line on stderr. Without an ID to compare, the release is offered. Yes downloads
  `hearthdaoc-client-<tag>.zip` into `<dest>/.update.XXXXXX`, checks its `setup.sh` and that `VERSION` says
  the tag, runs that `setup.sh` with the saved options and `--dest <dest>`, then starts the new `play.sh` with
  `HEARTHDAOC_NO_UPDATE=1`. A failure warns, keeps the saved tag and plays the installed release. Before each
  update, it removes `.update.*` folders left by one cut short (a power cut). `HEARTHDAOC_NO_UPDATE=1` turns
  the check off.

So every client bundle must keep `hearthdaoc-client-<tag>/setup.sh` and `VERSION`, and every `setup.sh` must
accept the options of the earlier ones: the players' `play.sh` runs it with them. Every `setup.sh` must also
change an install only once everything worked: after a failed update, `play.sh` tells the player that the
installed release starts. `UpdateRoundTripTests` in `client/tests/test_play.py` updates a client set up by
`setup.sh` with a bundle built by `build_bundles.sh`, and fails one halfway. Every release offers a client
update, even one that changed only the server.

## Syncing with upstream

1. Sync through a PR, not GitHub's **Sync fork** button: that commits straight to `main`, and merging is
   releasing (below), so it would publish before `deploy/upstream.lock` is updated. Merge the release tag,
   not `upstream/main`: upstream's `main` can be behind its release (for 0.35b it was 33 commits behind), and
   the code must be the release's code, the commit the lock pins.
   `git fetch upstream --tags && git switch -c sync/<version> origin/main && git merge v<version>`
2. If upstream published a new release, update `deploy/upstream.lock` (version, tag, commit, part
   sizes and hashes, manifest SHA-256, edition paths, `server_files`) from the new release's
   `download-manifest.json` and `PACKAGE MANIFEST.sha256`, on the same branch. `ServerFilesLockTests`
   (`deploy/tests/test_init_world.py`) fails when the server source names a `classic-*.json` file that the
   lock does not list, or the other way round.
3. Rebuild the client patch set (see Client patches above) and commit it on the same branch if it changed.
4. Check the fork's world fixes and hooks against the new release. Run the tests with `HDC_TEST_WORLD` set
   to the new clean classic world: `battlegrounds.py` changes a row only while it holds the value it
   expects, so a changed row fails the real-data tests, and the fix then needs a new version and marker. The same
   holds for `mob_fixes.json`'s `expect` values (no marker: update the entry's `expect`).
   The source checks in `deploy/tests/test_battlegrounds.py` list every fork hook in upstream files and
   every `TravelToBattleground` caller (the bots' only way in); a new one fails them until it is reviewed.
   Update the counts `deploy/HANDOFF.md` expects (navmeshes, restored spawns).
5. Push and open a PR; its CI builds and tests the image.
6. Merging it releases `v<upstream-version>-hearth.<n>` (a new upstream version restarts at `.1`).
7. On the server: `./hdc update` (`deploy/HANDOFF.md` → "Upgrading"). It backs up first, and for a release
   of another upstream version it upgrades the world itself. The `hdc` of the release before runs that
   update, so this starts with the update after 0.35b; from 0.34b to 0.35b, run `./hdc upgrade-world` and
   `./hdc up` by hand.

## Releases

Merging is releasing (`.github/workflows/server-image.yml`):

1. Every PR runs the full suite (docs-only PRs run nothing).
2. Every push to `main` runs the full suite on that commit (a docs-only merge runs nothing). If files that ship changed since the last
   release (`deploy/release_tag.py next`: what `deploy/Dockerfile` copies and `deploy/build_bundles.sh`
   bundles), the same run then publishes the next `v<upstream-version>-hearth.<n>` from that commit: the
   image, the tag and the GitHub release with both bundles and notes generated from the merged PRs.
   Docs, tests, CI and `release_tag.py` changes make no release. A failing test publishes nothing.
3. About 8 minutes after the merge, on the server: `./hdc update`. Linux players are offered the new
   client at their next launch (see Client updates).

The repository names no release: `deploy/build_bundles.sh` stamps the tag into the bundle's
`.env.example`, which is where `./hdc update` reads it, and HANDOFF's install step looks up the latest
release. Runs on `main` wait for each other, so releases are made one at a time. A run for a commit that
is older than an existing release publishes nothing, so re-running an old run cannot ship older code.

- To hold releases back (main still builds and tests), set the repository variable `HOLD_RELEASES` to
  `1`. Delete it, then merge the next PR or use Actions → server-image → Run workflow on `main`.
- If a release failed, a run on `main` was cancelled, or a merge made no release, fix it and merge, or
  use Run workflow on `main`: it releases everything shipped since the last release.
- Do not push `v*-hearth.*` tags by hand: nothing builds them, and the next release counts from them.
- Merging and Run workflow on `main` publish to the servers, so only the owner does either.

Each release `v<upstream-version>-hearth.<n>` publishes the image `ghcr.io/lometur/hearthdaoc:<tag>` and
attaches two assets: `hearthdaoc-deploy-<tag>.tar.gz` (compose file, `.env.example`, `hdc`, handoff) and
`hearthdaoc-client-<tag>.zip` (player scripts, the client patch set with both appliers, our `splash.mpk`, and
`VERSION`, the tag).
Neither contains EA game files. The release notes credit OfflineDAoC for the splash art.

The releases are the fork's changelog: each release's notes list the PRs merged since the release before
(`--generate-notes`), and each PR says what it changes. Upstream's own changes are in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Each release's notes also say what to do to update, in a "To update" section just before "What's Changed":

- **Owner:** `./hdc update`, plus anything else the release needs: a new `.env` setting, a world fix's line to
  check with `./hdc fixes` (the last start's world fixes; `./hdc logs` has lost them by then), a command to run
  once.
- **Players:** what they do, if anything: run `setup.sh` again, accept the update `play.sh` offers, or copy
  the new Windows files.

Each PR that ships files has its own "To update" section. CI publishes the release with the generated notes
only, so after it does, add the merged PRs' sections to the release notes
(`gh release edit <tag> --notes-file <file>`). For an example with more than the usual steps, see
v0.35b-hearth.1.
